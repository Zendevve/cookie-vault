## ✨ Features

**Cookie Vault** is a local-first Chrome extension designed for privacy-conscious users who need to migrate browser sessions between devices or browsers without re-authenticating.

- **🔒 Military-Grade Encryption**: Uses AES-256-GCM via the Web Crypto API. Your password never leaves your device.
- **📂 Universal Formats**:
  - Backup to encrypted `.cv` files.
  - Export to Netscape HTTP Cookie File format (compatible with `wget`, `curl`, `yt-dlp`).
  - Export to JSON for JDownloader.
- **🛡️ Zero Standing Privileges**: Runs with minimal permissions (`activeTab`) and only requests broad access when you explicitly initiate a backup.
- **🍪 Legacy Support**: Fully compatible with `.ckz` files from older cookie backup extensions.
- **✈️ Offline Ready**: Fully functional without an internet connection.

## 📖 Background Story

Migrating to a new computer or switching browsers is often a painful process of logging into dozens of websites again. Existing tools were either outdated, closed-source, or required sending data to a cloud server.

**Cookie Vault** was built to solve this problem with a "Security First" philosophy. We believe your session data is sensitive and should never leave your control. By implementing **Zero Standing Privileges** and **Local-First Architecture**, we ensure that even if the extension were compromised, your data remains safe.
